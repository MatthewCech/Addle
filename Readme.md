Addle will be a quick-and-dirty sketch, scratch, and doodle program for multiple platforms, written in C++ with Qt. It could, in a broad sense, be categorized as an art/drawing/painting program, however its goals and scope differ from those of most art programs. The design and user experience of Addle will emphasize and optimize readiness, quickness, and convenience, with little regard for the quality of the user's finished product. If Krita or Photoshop are an artist's fully equipped studio, Addle is the back of an envelope and a ballpoint pen. And that's what we want it to be.

Requires:
- Qt 5
- Sqlite3 development library (lsqlite3)
