if I non-virtually inherit IMakeable and IService does that mean I can use
static_cast in service locator? Probably a few cases that'd work like that.

when porting to Windows, make sure to specify cmake version 3.4 and add the

style: enum capitalization, BaseXXX or XXXBase?, initialize_p

zoom slider needs some work

destroy document views and presenters

cut icon
redo icon looks like it's disabled

tool mouse inputs

tighten up default editor tools

take user text translation keys out of FormatId and ToolId, and make the
presenters responsible for that instead (?). Opt instead for programmer-readable
names

clean up the preset helper API with initializier lists or something, even if
heaven forbid it makes lookups operate on logarithmic time instead of constant
time.

Canvas presenter and document presenter feel redundant, and document view feels
mis-named. I need to work on this structure.
